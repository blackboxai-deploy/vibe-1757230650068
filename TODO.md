# Pixel Pet App - Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Core Structure ✅
- [x] Create project plan and get user approval
- [ ] Create main app layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- [ ] Create main game page (`src/app/page.tsx`)

## Phase 2: Game Components 
- [ ] Create PixelPet component with animations (`src/components/PixelPet.tsx`)
- [ ] Create game logic hook (`src/hooks/usePetGame.ts`)

## Phase 3: Integration & Features
- [ ] Integrate all components in main page
- [ ] Add localStorage persistence
- [ ] Implement feeding system with cooldowns
- [ ] Add mood change animations

## Phase 4: Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Build application (`pnpm run build --no-lint`)
- [ ] Start production server (`pnpm start`)
- [ ] Test all pet interactions and animations
- [ ] Verify localStorage persistence
- [ ] Provide live preview URL
